        <p>Camel, (genus Camelus), either of three species of large ruminating hoofed mammals of arid Africa and Asia known for their ability to go for long periods without drinking. The Arabian camel, or dromedary (Camelus dromedarius), has one back hump, while the domesticated Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) and the wild Bactrian camel (C. ferus) have two.</p>
        <p>Here are some interesting facts about camels: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
            <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms</li>
            <li>Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</li>
            <li>Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!</li>
            <li>When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.</li>
        </ul>

         <p>A chameleon sits motionlessly on a tree branch. Suddenly its sticky, two-foot-long tongue snaps out at 13 miles an hour, wrapping around a cricket and whipping the yummy snack back into the reptile’s mouth.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Their feet work like salad tongs.</li>
